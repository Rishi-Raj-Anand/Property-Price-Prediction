# Property-Price-Prediction
<P>The objective is to predict the median house value in California districts based on features<br>
such as income, the number of rooms, geographical location, and proximity to the ocean.<br>
Given the dataset, we will develop regression models, evaluate their performance, and<br>
determine which model provides the best balance between predictive accuracy and<br>
interpretability.</P>
